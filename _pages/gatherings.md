## Internal gatherings

The team gather together every week for an internal group meeting where one of us present an interesting topic:
- a paper we have read,
- a current work in progress,
- a paper we are writing to get feedback,
- rehearse for an important talk.

## Invited speakers

Once in a while, we also invite researchers to come and present us their work. In the past, we had the pleasure to welcome:

## Statistics team gatherings

Additionally, the whole Statistics team of Ecole polytechnique gather every month for a 2h group meeting on a specific topic: long presentation introducing the research domain, followed by two shorter talks more specialized.
